# Project Plan for XOLO Pipeline

This document defines the complete roadmap, task breakdown, and progress tracking structure for the development of the **XOLO Pipeline**, a lightweight, modular, and user-friendly pipeline for animation, VFX, and commercials. It is designed to support individual artists and small studios, with scalability toward networked or cloud workflows.

## ‚úÖ To Do

### Issue: Implement `xolo init` command  
**Description:**  
Create CLI command to initialize a new project. Prompt user for project name, root path, and global asset directory.

### Issue: Configure global settings YAML  
**Description:**  
Store default paths, OCIO configuration, project type, resolution, and metadata in a central YAML file editable via CLI.

### Issue: Implement `xolo launch` command  
**Description:**  
Allow users to launch DCCs (e.g., Nuke, Maya, Houdini) from the CLI with correct environment variables.

### Issue: Define backend API structure with FastAPI  
**Description:**  
Design and scaffold backend routes: `/projects`, `/shots`, `/assets`, `/tasks`, `/users`, `/publishes`.

### Issue: Create web UI skeleton with Astro  
**Description:**  
Build basic layout in `frontend/` using Astro (without React). Include: Dashboard, Shots, Versions, Settings.

### Issue: CLI option to create shots manually  
**Description:**  
Add support in CLI to manually create sequences and shots, auto-creating folder structures and metadata YAMLs.

### Issue: Add CLI option to choose Nuke Studio or manual ingest  
**Description:**  
Let user decide whether to ingest timeline automatically or create manually when running `xolo ingest`.

### Issue: Implement API endpoint to receive publishes  
**Description:**  
Create FastAPI route to receive publish metadata and store it in a file-based or future DB system.

### Issue: Display publishes and thumbnails in frontend  
**Description:**  
Render published versions with embedded thumbnails or MP4 preview videos.

### Issue: Assign task status (In Progress, Done, Approved)  
**Description:**  
Enable frontend and backend sync of task/shot status updates with visual indicators.

### Issue: Add OCIO config auto-load  
**Description:**  
Auto-load and inject OCIO environment variables when launching a DCC or creating a project.

### Issue: Create `project_type.yaml` templates  
**Description:**  
Define YAML templates for each project type (animation, VFX, commercial, short). Each template includes default folders, resolution, and metadata.

### Issue: Versioned file and folder naming system  
**Description:**  
Standardize `v001`/`v002` naming in both folders and files. Ensure version match between metadata, file, and folder.

### Issue: Use `rich` for CLI formatting  
**Description:**
